# FFXIV Job Roulette

## About

A simple web app that lets you spin a roulette wheel to help you decide a job to play in the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV which has an expanded free trial that you can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning HEAVENSWARD and STORMBLOOD expansions up to level 70 for free with no restrictions on playtime.

The app is built with Vite + TypeScript + Vue.js. The roulette wheel component is [XiaoLin1995's Vue Fortune Wheel](https://github.com/XiaoLin1995/vue-fortune-wheel).

This project is currently deployed and accessible [here](https://ffxiv-job-roulette.onrender.com/).
